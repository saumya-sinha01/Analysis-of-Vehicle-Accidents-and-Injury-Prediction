# Analysis-of-Vehicle-Accidents-and-Injury-Prediction

Problem Statement
This research aims to analyze crashes, road conditions, and weather to find features that have the strongest correlation to accidents in the San Jose area. The goal of this research will allow for machine learning models to predict future accident severity, which has the potential to positively impact decision-makers in their ability to adapt policy for safety measures.

Methodology 
	The techniques that will be used to predict injuries caused by car accidents are Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Xgboost, and Neural Networks algorithms like LSTM. These techniques will be implemented in the order of algorithm complexity. Various univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis techniques will be used to analyze the data to bring out key pieces of information that can be used to build the machine learning models. These analyses will be performed using python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. 

Conclusion
The research has the ability to identify features that strongly attribute to car crashes, and make predictions on the severity of injuries. Some drawbacks to the research will be the lack of ability to identify drivers that have been involved in multiple accidents in a given time span, due to privacy. This level of detail could be beneficial in potentially identifying risk patterns that lead to injury. Perhaps in the future, this research could be further developed by making use of data from cameras to automate the process of identifying the injury severity of a car crash.
